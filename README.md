# Bank Transaction

The money.erl is the main process. It creates individual bank and customer processes based on the number of inputs. Once the processes are created, the customer will be requesting the bank for loans. And the bank will be approving or denning the loan requests based on the constraints. All the updates will be printed by the main process.

Place all the files in a directory and run the file money.erl
You can add, remove or modify the entries in the bank and customer .txt file preserving its syntax.
